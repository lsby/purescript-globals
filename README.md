# DEPRECATED

The library is no longer maintained under this repository. Relevant functionality has been moved into other repositories:

- Number values and operations like `isFinite`, `infinity`, parsing, and formatting have moved to [`purescript-numbers`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-numbers)
- Integer parsing has moved to [`purescript-integers`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-integers)
- URI encoding and decoding based on JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent` and `decodeURIComponent` have moved to [`purescript-js-uri`](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-js-uri), and a more complete URI library can be found in [`purescript-uri`](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-uri).

[The previous releases](https://github.com/purescript-deprecated/purescript-globals/releases) will continue to work for older libraries that still depend on them.
